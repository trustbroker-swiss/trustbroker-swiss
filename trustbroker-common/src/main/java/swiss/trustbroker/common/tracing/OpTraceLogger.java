/**
 * This class is used to do manual operation tracing (OP-tracing). The methods to emit log entries are pairs. If the first
 * method of the call chain is entered one uses logInitialEnter to initialize the RequestContext and
 * emit a log entry. If one leaves that method one uses logInitialReturn to delete the RequestContext
 * and emit a log entry. For all other methods one uses logEnter and logReturn. If one calls another
 * service (so one is client) logClientCall is used to extend the traceId to mark that call and to
 * emit a log entry. If one returns from that call one uses logClientReturn to restore the traceId
 * and to emit a log entry.
