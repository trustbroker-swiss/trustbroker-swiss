= Scripting

XTB supports scripting within the federation processing for various purposes (see processing model in the architecture section).

The scripting engine is https://groovy-lang.org/index.html[Groovy] based on the underlying Java libraries.

This allows a wide range of manipulations so make sure that the code you are injecting via scripts meets security
requirements, specifically:

- Input validation on the values that are processed.
- Manipulating identity (specifically ``CPRepsonse.nameId``) and authorization attributes (e.g. roles claims) as required.
- Establish a review process via pull requests in your GitOps repository.


== LOG

The LOG object allows access to the logging facility using the SLF4J API. You can use error, warn, info, debug and trace methods
with parameter binding:

[source,groovy]
----
include::../../../../xtb-gitops-demo/trustbroker-inventories/DEMO/definition/scripts/DebugRpRequest.groovy[]
----


== RPRequest

The ``RPRequest`` object is bound to computationally influence in-bound messages, specifically:

- Deciding on home realm discovery (HRD) routing based on the HTTP or SAML/OIDC protocol (you can drop or retain CPs).
- Handling authentication context class mappings towards claims providers (you can validate and map RPRequest.contextClasses on
the way to the CP).

Example:
[source,java]
----
include::../../../../xtb-gitops-demo/trustbroker-inventories/DEMO/definition/scripts/HrdAutoSelectClaimsProvider.groovy[]
----


== HTTPRequest

Along the ``RPRequest`` a groovy script has access to the HTTP request using the JSR340 API.


== CPRepsonse

The ``CPRepsonse`` object is bound to handle claims provider responses and manipulate the relying party responses during the phases
documented in the Architecture.

These members are of interest for mapping between CP and RP:

- nameId: The subject name identifier passed as the authentication result from the CP, also represented internally as
the NameId 'http://schemas.xmlsoap.org/ws/2005/05/identity/claims/nameidentifier' attribute.
- nameIdFormat: Some relying parties care about the SAML name identifier format to assert a certain authentication quality.
This allows to overrule what the CP has decided in case of integration problems.
- contextClasses: Like on the ``RPRequest`` (requested authentication context class references, in short QoA) the CP should respond
with one of the requested QoA.

There are the following members to get and set claims:

- attributes: They come from the CPs and are sent to RPs with an OriginalIssuer=CP-IssuerID
- userDetails: XTB has an ``IdmQueryService`` abstraction. Claims from such user registries should use this to store claims.
- properties: Groovy scripts computing derived claims should store them here so the ``SetupRP``/``ProfileRP`` configuration show the
contract properly.
- claims: These are the OIDC attributes used for OIDC token assembly

The names correspond to the selection 'Definition' lists in the configuration and are associated as follows:

- ``CPResponse`` holds the actual data based on the definition objects in the configuration
- Definition are copies including the value list and are used to generate the SAML attribute or OIDC claim output

The debug script shown at the beginning will expose all this data on ``TRACE`` level.

Please be careful what you use. If not mentioned in this section, you might produce some unwanted results.
