= Configuration

This section provides insights into the various configurations and their purpose.
All configuration files maintained in a git branch, XTB is started with, are pulled within one minute by a scheduled job.
To speed up experimenting or engineering configurations, run the ``reconfig.sh`` script on the side.

So the configuration workflow is as follows:

- Run XTB with a ``GIT_URL`` pointing to your GitOps repository (``CONFIG_BRANCH=master`` is default).
- Engineer your configuration and push them (the usual git add, commit, push workflow applies).
- Wait until the console shows the reconfiguration or speed it up using the ``reconfig.sh`` script mentioned at the end.
- Test your changes.


== Global Settings

XTB is a spring-boot microservice running with a builtin application.yml for defaults and a spring.profiles.active=DEMO
activated application.yml from the GitOps repository overriding or completing these defaults.

The following annotated demo file shows insights:
[source,yaml]
----
include::../../../../xtb-gitops-demo/trustbroker-inventories/DEMO/config/application.yml[]
----


== Claims Provider Definitions

This configuration defines the identification and visual aspects of CPs shown on the HRD screen. HRD (home realm discovery)
provides the means for a user to select from multiple CPs one, where an onboarding was done and an account is available.

The HRD screen is not shown, when only one CPs is federated. The definition is necessary anyway.
The DEMO setup uses the SAML mock in 2 instances.

[source,xml]
----
include::../../../../xtb-gitops-demo/trustbroker-inventories/DEMO/definition/ClaimsProviderDefinition.xml[]
----


== Single Sign On Groups

SSO groups provide a means to join multiple relying parties into a single login group during a period defined by the group. A
login with the same CP is then not required anymore.

[source,xml]
----
include::../../../../xtb-gitops-demo/trustbroker-inventories/DEMO/definition/SetupSSOGroups.xml[]
----

== Claims Party Setup

The SetupCP.xml defines the technical association with an CP.
It's id must match the one in the ``ClaimsProviderDefinition.xml``.
A trust anchor is required because SAML responses from an CP must be signed.
Assertion signing is optional but recommended.
The incoming assertion attributes are declared to also document the expected input from the CP.

include::../../../../xtb-gitops-demo/trustbroker-inventories/DEMO/definition/SetupCP_SAML-Mock-1.xml[]
----


== Relying Party Profile

Profiles provide a mechanism to declare a template for multiple relying parties using the same protocols, claims definitions
and mapping procedures.

The content of a ReylingParty declared in here needs to be correctly ordered according to the configuration schema (see
``ReylingParty.java`` or the XSD files in the docker image).

The order reflects the processing model (see architecture) so reading a ProfileRP or SetupRP top down reflects which elements
are used when processing the federation:

- Input validation (issuer/client IDs, signatures using truststore, security policies affecting request processing)
- Handling protocols (Saml, Oidc sections)
- Applying XTB features (like SSO)
- Dispatching towards CPs using ClaimsProviderMappings
- On response from CP apply CP AttributesSelection filtering
- Invoke IDM service applying list of configured IDMQuery (not shown in OSS yet)
- On response to RP apply UserDetailsSelection (IDM source), PropertiesSelection (computed by scripts)  and ClaimsSelection (towards OIDC) filtering
- Scripts affect the overall processing and are last

== Relying Party Setup

The ``SetupRP.xml`` defines the federation with the SAML service provider or OIDC application client based on the ``ProfileRP.xml`` it
refers to.

The profile is optional but recommended to reduce bad copy&paste habits and maintain site policies within few profiles.
The merging is done at startup or when a git configuration change is detected.
Broken configurations are ignored for resilience.

== PKI Setup

=== OIDC

OIDC uses automatically generated keys that are rotated (per default) weekly.

Clients not checking the JWKS endpoint:

- when the kid claim in the header does not match the local key set.
- periodically but at least once a week

might run into JWT signature verification problems.
Key rotation settings need to be tuned in this case in the global configuration (see above).
It's recommended to fix the client instead.

=== SAML

XTB supports various keystore formats, but we recommend the first 2:

- ``keystore.pem``: OpenSSL PEM formatted certificate along with the private RSA key, protected by the PKI_PASSPHRASE from the
runtime environment (K8S secret, CO vault)
- ``truststore.pem``: The same but no private key in their. This one instead might contain multiple trusted certificates (e.g. when
the peer is in the process of replacing its signer)
- ``keystore.p12``: PKCS12 keystores with or without private keys.
- ``keystore.jks``: Java keystores are fast but not recommended, use one of the other formats.

Tools to work with keystores:

- openssl
- keytool (mainly to read JKS and transfer private keys into PKCS12 files for openssl handling)

Please check the installation documentation for signer generation.


== Groovy Scripts

Setup and profile configurations can refer to groovy scripts to customize federation data and flow.
Check the scripting section for insights.


== UI Setup

XTB has a small frontend for various purposes, mainly HRD (see above) and error display.

The following can be customized:

- config: The global settings contain a few UI influencing settings (e.g. the site specific language cookie, if the browser
language shall be overruled)
- translations: Texts for languages ``de``, ``fr``, ``en`` and ``it``.
- images: The tile images used on the HRD screen and declared in the ClaimsProviderDefinition.xml (see above)
- assets: The theme resources to provide a corporate identity (icons, style, logo)

Text handling:

- Text keys can be found in ``trustbroker-frontend/src`` (look for the ng translate items).
- Texts are maintained in texts.json for convenience and can be exchanged as texts.csv for translation services.
- The ``text2json.py`` script checks the maintained master file and generates the derived ``de/fr/en/it.json`` translations.


=== Theme Customizing

See ``xtb-gitops-demo`` for assets and check the CSS to see if the styling of the interactive parts of XTB (usually HRD and
error screen) fits your needs.


== Reconfiguration Process

On first time use the repository is cloned into the ``configCache``.

XTB from then on checks the GitOps repository for changes and if commits are detected:

- git pull the changes in ``configCache``
- copy the selected stage profile into configuration/new
- validate the configuration
- if ok activate the configuration by swapping latest configuration into the previous one and the new one takes its place.

This allows to diff latest against previous to see what changed.
Changes are also ``INFO`` logged in the console.

During development the following script speeds up the re-configuration process:
