= Docker Installation

On a docker host XTB can be installed as a service mesh with docker-compose.
Requirements:

- Current distribution of a docker enabled Linux system
- Docker version 24 or above
- Alternatively: Podman version 4 or above (security restrictions apply)
- Network access to download images from internet docker registries

The setup will provide these endpoints:

| Container | Endpoints | Remarks

| ``mariadb`` providing session and token storage.
| mysql --protocol=tcp --host=localhost --port=3306 --user=root --password=secret
| Investigate storage: show databases; use TBSS16; show tables; desc TB_AUTH_SESSION_CACHE;

| ``gitea`` providing a gitops repository storage to play around with (optional, you can use your repo server).

* Health: http://localhost:3000/api/healthz
* Console: http://localhost:3000
* SSH access: ssh://git@localhost:222
| Documentation: https://docs.gitea.com/

| ``trustbroker-application`` providing the actual federation service.

TLS engineering:

- Server: Please refer to https://docs.spring.io/spring-boot/docs/current/reference/html/application-properties.html#application-properties.server.server.ssl.enabled
- Server: Staying on http within a secure infrastructure you can do TLS on load-balancers or ingress controllers.
- Clients: You can in general map a JKS into the containers ``/usr/lib/jvm/zulu17-ca/lib/security/cacerts``
- SAM artifact resolution client: You can engineer ``keystore/outgoing-tls-trust/truststore.p12``, PKCS12 recommended.

When switching to server TLS you can discard the

You can find the scripts mentioned in this section in the ``trustbroker-install`` module on GitHub.


== Install docker-compose (optional)

If you do not have a docker infrastructure that supports the 'docker compose' command you can install it as follows:
https://docs.docker.com/compose/install/standalone/[Install docker-compose] on your system:

In short:
[source,bash]
----
sudo bash
curl -SL https://github.com/docker/compose/releases/download/v2.27.0/docker-compose-linux-x86_64 -o
/usr/local/bin/docker-compose
chmod 555 /usr/local/bin/docker-compose
----

== Default Setup

The demo setup should run out of the box as follows:

- Download https://github.com/trustbroker-swiss/trustbroker-swiss/trustbroker-install/docker/docker-compose.yml[docker-compose.yml]
- Download https://github.com/trustbroker-swiss/trustbroker-swiss/trustbroker-install/docker/env-vault.conf[env-vault.conf]
- Download https://github.com/trustbroker-swiss/trustbroker-swiss/trustbroker-install/docker/run.sh[run.sh]

Run the setup:
```
bash run.sh
```

Access the setup via the mocked demo relying parties at http://localhost:7070.
You can use the browser's development tools and the SAML-tracer plugin to observe the traffic.

If the docker image pulling fails because of authorization issues, ask for access on the
https://github.com/orgs/trustbroker-swiss/discussions/1[trustbroker.swiss discussion forum].

== Customize Setup

You might want to tweak the development setup:

- Switch to another image version or distribution points
- Set new secrets for state cache and keystores (p12/pem files).
- Generate new SSH keys to access GitOps repository.
- Use other external ports.
- Remove Gitea because you have a remote repository already or use gitea actually so you can play with the configuration.

Example vault (retained in CI or K8S vault for production setups) injected into ``docker-compose.yml`` via ENV:
[source,bash]
----
include::../../../../trustbroker-install/docker/env-vault.conf[]
----

Example docker compose depending on the vault (see ${VAR} references) that you might want to tweak towards using external
sessiondb and/or git repository server:
[source,yaml]
----
include::../../../../trustbroker-install/docker/docker-compose.yml[]
----


== Re-Generate GitOps SSH Key

To generate an own SSH setup, execute setup-ssh.sh:
[source,bash]
----
include::../../../../trustbroker-install/docker/setup-ssh.sh[]
----


== Setup Gitea Server

For trials, you can use the Gitea server as shown in the docker-compose setup, you need to switch from the github to the gitea
URL for the xtb-gitops-demo repository..

[source,bash]
----
sudo docker-compose up gitea
----

Setup manually:

- Connect to http://localhost:3000/ and confirm the default server setup.
- Register user ``trustbroker-swiss`` and login.
- Add content of ``ssh/id_rsa.pub`` (and/or your own) to: User >> Settings >> SSH/PGP Keys >>  Manage SSH Keys >> Add Key
- Create a repository ``xtb-gitops-demo``.
- Optional: For http access: User >> Settings >> Applications >>  Manage Access Tokens >> Generate Token

The resulting access token can be set along the ``GIT_URL`` as ``GIT_TOKEN`` or mapped to ``/etc/trustbroker/keys/git_token``.

Note that access token or SSH key are only required, if the git repository is private (gitea default).
You can make it public in the repository settings, in which case you do not need access keys.
You then can add/edit/delete files in the web UI and read the repository without a login.

Clone the public demo repository:
[source,bash]
----
git clone -b main git@github.com/trustbroker-swiss/xtb-gitops-demo
cd xtb-gitops-demo
----

Before doing so you might want to have your own new signer (see SetupRP/ProfileRP Certificates for use):
[source,bash]
----
cd trustbroker-inventories/DEMO/keystore/token-signer
./setup-signer.sh # my-subject my-passphrase
git commit -m "Created XTB signer" ./
----

Import your initial trial repository:
[source,bash]
----
git remote set-url origin ssh://git@localhost:222/trustbroker-swiss/xtb-gitops-demo.git
git push -u origin main
----

Alternatively, use HTTP:
[source,bash]
----
git remote set-url origin http://git@localhost:3000/trustbroker-swiss/xtb-gitops-demo.git
git push
----

Run the services in the directory where you stored the tweaked ``docker-compose.yml`` and ``env-vault.conf`` using the following
https://github.com/trustbroker-swiss/trustbroker-swiss/trustbroker-install/docker/run.sh[run.sh]:
[source,bash]
----
include::../../../../trustbroker-install/docker/run.sh[]
----
