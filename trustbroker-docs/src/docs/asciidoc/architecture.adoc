= Architecture

XTB is a federation service providing these capabilities:

- routing authentication requests between relying parties (in short RP, also known as service provider / SP) and claims providers
  (CP also known as identity provider / IDP) allowing a user to select the home realm or computationally doing
  home realm discovery (HRD) via scripting
- mapping claims/attributes between CP and RP (like authentication context classes, SAML attributes and OIDC claims)
- backing logins with a single-sign-on session store to prevent logins for participating RPs when Quality of Authentication
(QoA) is sufficient provided by the same CP
- auditing login events as a central party
- supporting GitOps having a tracked, versioned and reviewable configuration repository

The supported protocols are:

- SAML 2.0 on RP and CP side (SAML POST and redirect binding, artifact binding having higher integration effort and more
complex operational impact can be used too)
- OIDC 1.0 on RP side focussing on the best practice sub-set (authorization code flow with PKCE for frontend and with client
authentication for backends)


Actors and components explained:

[cols="1,10"]
|===
|Component | Purpose

|User-Agent
|The client is usually a browser in case of front-channel controlled authentication or otherwise a OIDC adapter running either
in the browser using JavaScript or in a backend.

|Relying Party Service
|Handles the interaction with the application side based on ``SetupRP.xml`` definitions.

|Claims Provider Service
|Handles the interaction with the CPs based on ``SetupCP.xml`` definitions.

|Authentication Service
|Handles the federation between RP and CP service.

|OIDC Service
|Handles the OIDC authorization code flow based on the
https://docs.spring.io/spring-authorization-server/reference/overview.html#feature-list[Spring Authorization Server]
To separate SAML and OIDC implementation sub-systems, the OIDC service is federated via SAML.

|HRD Controller
|Handles the interaction with the user when selecting a CP form the HRD selection screen.

|Script Service
|Allows to hook groovy scripts to manipulate the federation data and flow. See processing model for supported hooks and the
configuration section for a few examples.

|SSO Service
|Allows multiple RP's to share a session on the XTB. The SSO mechanism is based on cookies and device tracking and can be
overridden via SAML AuthnRequest (forceAuthn) and OIDC authorize request (prompt=login). Minimal LoA requirements should be
applied using this service.
