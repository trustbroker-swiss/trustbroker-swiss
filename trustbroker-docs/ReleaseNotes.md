### Features

- OIDC CP support finalized.
- HRD: Add support for multiple ClaimsProviderDefinition.xml

  - In addition to CP.id also matched against CP.name or new CP.hrdHintAlias from the ClaimsProviderDefinition.xml for decoupling.
- First shot at an LDAP implementation of the IDM interface.

### Improvements

- Check Javadoc entries "@since 1.10.0" for details on new configuration options.

- Added resilience support on StateCacheService and OAuth2AuthorizationService  with configurable delay and retries (see StateCacheProperties).
- SAML:
    - Support SAML redirect binding for logout notifications and LogoutResponse: SloResponse binding=”REDIRECT”
    - New options to control signature and encryption of messages / assertions.
    - Support optional inline encryption key placement.

- New options for Qoa configuration to control handling of inbound values.

### Bugfixes

  - Encryption metadata shows correct certificates
- Ignore special QoA values like StrongestPossible for minimum/maximum calculations.
- Ignore urltester on Internet access.
- Fixes and layout improvements for new HRD.
- Accept HTTP X-Request-Id being a UUID as some /robots.txt endpoints do not use hex32 but uuid32.

## v1.9.0.20250515T072935Z

### Bugfixes

 - Fix oauth2_authorization table not reap of unfinished authorizations or ones missing a refresh token (i.e. rows with NULL values).
   Note: This was not changed in 1.9.0 compared to previous releases.
   So depending on the database setup this could lead to leaking rows in earlier releases as well.


## v1.9.0.20250415T132527Z

### Dependency upgrades

- Spring Boot 3.4.4
- Spring Security 6.4.4
- Apache CXF 4.0.6
- Angular 18.2
- Oblique 11.3.4

### Features:

- New HRD layout:
  - Configurable banners on top.
  - Tiles grouped by configured order.
  - Disabled per default (GUI feature HRD_BANNERS, ClaimsProvider.order).
  -- The old layout will be removed earliest in 1.12.0.

- QoA mapping and optional enforcement from/to RP and CP:
  - QoA element for ClaimsParty/RelyingParty.
  - HRD disabling CPs with insufficient requested and enforced QoA

- HRD CP mappings can now be configured in ProfileRP and can be picked in SetupRP by using the new enabled=true flag on any of the configured ClaimsProviderMappings entries.
- First shot at OIDC protocol provider support towards CPs, not yet functional end-to-end.
- OIDC CP mock to generate OIDC tokens for automated testing.

### Improvements

- Browser support: Add polyfills for older browser versions – last 4 Chrome/FF/Edge and last 5 Safari versions.
- To prevent unnecessary pod restarts when the infrastructure has problems, configure and use /actuator/health/readiness and /actuator/health/liveness probes.
  - Added timing information for readiness/liveness probes.
- Error handling of ‘state not found’ exceptions was improved in the global exception handler allowing to configure a separated error message and user flow.
- Claims mapping: The new ClaimsSelection can be used to aggregate all claims sources using Definition source instead.
  - Supported sources are CP, IDM, IDM:queryname, SCRIPT (when groovy scripts manipulate IDM claims), PROPS, and CONFIG
  - The ConstAttributes section was deprecated and can be replaced by ClaimsSelection specifying the value in the configuration. The CONFIG source is used to identify these claims.
- SAML RP side dynamic SAML AuthnRequest.ProtocolBinding supported instead of assuming a fixed configuration in XTB.
- WS-Trust clock skew supported to handle clients using system clocks running in the future (the same skew configuration than for SAML protocol is used).
- OIDC QoA and state handling was improved by using the spring-security continue marker (identifying an ongoing login) and in addition supporting acr_values as a trigger to check for SSO and step-up in addition to the already implemented prompt=login support. Forcing a login can therefore also be done with the acr_values in the authorize request.
- HRD handles disabled CPs now in rendering (e.g. controlled via announcements).
- Script API: Scripts can skip/enforce features via CPResponse/RPRequest
- Reduce unnecessary warnings in logs.

### Bugfixes

- Invalidate XTB session in case of session compatibility issues between XTB releases.
- Script based CPResponse flow policy shows support info on error screens.
- Error screen with ‘Continue to application’ now also works without a state (before user was stuck on the screen).
- OIDC logout: Consider realm logout requests without a client_id parameter to address ambiguities between multiple SetupRP that contain the same redirect_uri
- Retry to handle 'SAML AuthnRequest state lost' problem when establishing OIDC session on redirect from SAML to OIDC sub-system
- Fix reset of selected profile when logging in with a new RP using SSO.

### Security

- Validate OIDC error redirect URIs against config for error redirects as well.


## v1.8.0.20250218T172031Z

### Improvements

- New parameters to control OIDC refresh token lifetime.
- _SubjecNameMappings_ now configurable on both RP and CP side.
- Flow policies support direct redirects.
- _OpsDebug_ feature improved allowing customization of log levels.
- Script compilation errors are now reflected on status API.
- Script hook _BeforeResponse_ added to allow scripts on the complete, yet unfiltered output data.
- new _OpsAudit_ logging allows controlling what data is audited.
- Dependencies updated.
    
### Fixes

- OIDC setup without client secret addressed with a private _authorization_code_ lead to HTTP 302 instead of 401.
- Fix selection of default language if there is no language cookie.


## v1.7.0.20241021T070518Z

### Improvements

- Error page is now sent as JSON if any of the HTTP headers configured in _trustbroker.config.oidc.jsonErrorPageHeaders_ matches.
- Error logging cleanup.
- _RPRequest_ (with _rpIssuer_, _applicationName_, _contextClasses_, _referer_) object is now available to script hooks in the response phase.
    
### Fixes

- Disable Spring in-memory session storage that led to a memory leak causing out of memory conditions under load.
- _refresh_token_ expiration was not considered during reaping of OIDC tokens.


## v1.7.0.20240926T102809Z

### Features

- XML configurations can now be structured into nested directories.
- Configurable support debug feature added to produce DEBUG logs if signaled via HTTP protocol.
- Micrometer for Prometheus monitoring.
- New APIs:
  - _/api/v1/config/status_ to report broken configurations (access restricted to internal network).
  - _/api/v1/config/schemas/{file}_ provides current configuration XSDs (access restricted to internal network).
  - _/api/v1/version_ showing the deployed version.

###  Improvements

- OIDC:
  - New attribute mapper for e-mail with lower case transformation and de-duplication.
  - Fragment _redirect_uri_ handling supports arbitrary non-RFC3986 compliant query and fragment parameters now (caused breaking applications using deep-links with parameters).
  - SSO cookie also set on OIDC domain for improved global logout handling.
- Tracing: 
  - OpenTelemetry-aligned conversation ID support added.
  - Additional HTTP protocol detail logging can be enabled if a conversation ID is defined.
- Markup/markdown support for translations improved to allow sanitized HTML and markdown links (except in top level titles, button names, labels). 
- Upgrade to latest JDK/17, Spring Boot, Oblique.

### Fixes

- OIDC:
  - Fixed issues in session probing with _prompt=none_.
  - Fixed device ID check breaking SSO with OIDC session joiners. This also fixes a potential performance issue.
  - Fixed performance issues on /introspect and /revoke (additional indexes on _oauth2_authorization_ table).
  - _redirect_uri_ containing non-existing DNS endpoints could result in 15 to 25 seconds timeouts on validation.
- Fixed issue on bootstrap for not yet existing keystore.
- Fixed _RequestDeniedException_ log message _cpIssuer=null_.

### Compatibility

- Check for _Potentially breaking changes_ Javadoc comments in _trustbroker/federation/xmlconfig_ and _trustbroker/config_:
  - Some additional XML values are now validated via XSD.
  - The new _trustbroker.config.globalScriptPath_ was formerly included in the default _trustbroker.config.scriptPath_.


## v1.6.0.20240819T100141Z
