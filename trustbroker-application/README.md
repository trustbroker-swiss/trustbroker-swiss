# Swiss Trustbroker Application (XTB)

Spring-boot microservice implementing SAML brokerage between relying parties (RP) and claim providers (CP).
In the Oasis SAML terminology we are an IdP from the RP side and a SP towards the IdPs we integrate.

The service provides these main services:
- / only maps the favicon.ico and index.html
- /app contains the angular frontend
- /api/v1 provides the REST API for the application and the SAML endpoints
- /oauth2, /login and /userinfo provide OIDC service endpoints

Configuration is done via spring-profiles and a bootstrap based on these ENV variables:
- GIT_URL to fecth the runtime configuration for dispatching and HRD
- TRUSTBROKER_HOME as a configuration cache and providing the SSH key to contact GIT (see ../config/env.proj for DEV details)
