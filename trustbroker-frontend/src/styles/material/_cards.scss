// Global card styles
// These styles are based on the current styleguide and have the following implications:
// - there are 4 card sizes with fixed width and this should be used always
// - small cards are not used as a single element for page layout and they should not have any responsive behavior
// and they are the only ones having images
// - medium and large cards are always used as single element on a page and they are horizontally centered
// - extra large cards are always used a a single element on a page and they have a spacing value from the left
// side of the screen: $extra-large-card-left-spacing
// - responsive behavior (other than small cards): in case the screen width goes below the width of a card (or the card with plus
// the fix spacing in case of extra large) the card will transform into the next smaller card. In case the width goes below the
// medium card width the card becomes full-width
